## DEV NOTES

1. Requirements:
   * g++ >= g++-11
   * clang-format-17 ([ubuntu download tutorial](https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2023/09/how-to-install-clang-17-or-16-in-ubuntu-22-04-20-04/amp/?fbclid=IwAR1ZfJpoiitjwn8aMlKVWpFdkYmUqtaQwraJBju09v1gtc0jQANTgVeCuMY))

2. Building and running tests:

    * By hand

        ```
        > cd <project-root>/test
        > make all
        ```
        > ./test
        ```
        ```
        > ./test -ts="<test-suite-name>"
        ```
    
    * By CMake
        ```
        > cd <project-root>/cmake
        > cmake ..
        > make
        ```
        > ./test/out/test
        ```
        ```
        > ./test/out/test -ts="<test-suite-name>"
        ```

3. Error fixing:

    In case you face an error in Windows saying that:
        ```
        ...\profile.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disable on this system. ...
        ```
    Then you should run the following command to enable running scripts by Windows' Makefile:
        ```
        > PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
        ```
